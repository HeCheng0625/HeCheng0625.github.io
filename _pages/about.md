I'm Yuancheng Wang (王远程), a PhD student at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), SDS](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), supervised by Prof. [Zhizheng Wu](http://www.drwuz.com/). before that, I received the B.S. degree at CUHK-Shenzhen. My research focuses on **generative AI for speech** and **multimodal learning**. I am currently a research scientist intern at Meta Superintelligence Labs (formerly GenAI), working on enhancing the speech capabilities of Llama models. Previously, I have also interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and ByteDance.

I have developed several advanced TTS models, including NaturalSpeech 3 and MaskGCT, and I am one of the main contributors and leaders of the open-source Amphion [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion) toolkit. My work has been published at top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, and IEEE SLT with citations of 700+.

**I am looking for a full-time position now, feel free to contact me if you are interested in my experience!**
